This is what led me into the interesting and fascinating world of AL

I built a chatbot using OpenAI API, with the help of large language models like gpt – 4, and Claude.

To build this chatbot I used these LLMs for a backend and frontend for my project and I integrated the code I got using vs code and using the API key I got a web simplified web-based interface of the one’s which different LLM provide like chat gpt, deepseek, perplexity etc.

Through this project I also explored how various web platform integrate different API’s to enhance user experience. It highlighted how multiple LLMs can complement each other in their specialized domains.

Throughout the development process, I gained hands-on experience with APIs and deepened my understanding of LLM capabilities. This inspired me to further explore machine learning and neural networks.
